# Entanglement Entropy by Different Methods

This part will introduce several methods to compute the entanglement entropy of a quantum system. The methods include:

- 1.1 [Entanglement Entropy by Hadamard Test](./qurrent_1_1_HadamardTest/basic_usage.ipynb)
- 1.2 [Entanglement Entropy by Randomized Measurement](./qurrent_1_2_RandomizedMeasure/basic_usage.ipynb)
- 1.3 [Entanglement Entropy by Classical Shadow](./qurrent_1_4_ClassicalShadow/basic_usage.ipynb)
